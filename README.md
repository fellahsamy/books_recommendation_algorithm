# Book Recommendation System with Web Interface

This project is a book recommendation system developed using Flask, Pandas, and NumPy. It focuses on recommending books that are highly rated by users who have also positively rated a book that the current user has selected or liked. This approach is akin to a user-based collaborative filtering method in recommender systems.

## Technologies Used

* Backend: Flask (Python)
* Data Analysis and Processing: Pandas and NumPy
* Database: SQLite or any SQL database for storing user data, book details, ratings, etc.
